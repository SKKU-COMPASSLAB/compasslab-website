        This paper proposes a novel mechanism called Event-driven Uncore Frequency Scaler (eUFS) to improve 
        the energy efficiency of the HPC systems. UFS exploits the hardware events such as LAPI (Last-level 
        Cache Accesses Per Instructions) and CPI (Clock Cycles Per Instruction) to dynamically adjusts the uncore 
        frequency. Hardware events are collected at a reference time period, and the target uncore frequency is 
        determined using the collected event and the previous uncore frequency. Experiments with the NPB 
        benchmarks demonstrate that the eUFS reduces the energy consumption by 6% on average for class C and 
        D NPB benchmarks while it only increases the execution time by 2% on average.
