        I started as an associate engineer in the Device Solutions division at Samsung Electronics in 2008, where I worked on SOC development for various technologies including HDD, SSD, NVMe, NVMeOF, and CXL. Through the SSIT course, I joined COMPASS Lab to deepen my understanding of computer architecture. I am currently conducting research in the field of CXL.
