        Since joining Samsung Electronics Memory Business Division in 2015, I have been responsible for Pre & Post Silicon verification of SoC products such as UFS and SSD. Through the SSIT Course, I joined COMPASS LAB to deepen my understanding of Computer Architecture and am currently researching the CXL field.
