        I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Semiconductor Systems Engineerings at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). My major research experiences and interests include the design of low power, reliable, and high-performance microarchitectures and memory systems. I received the PhD in Computer Science from KAIST, Korea, in 2015. Prior to joining SKKU, I was a Research Scientist at IBM TJ Watson Research Center and a Senior Engineer at Samsung Electronics.
