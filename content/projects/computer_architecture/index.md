        The term "computer" refers initially to people who performed calculations manually or with mechanical aids. Later, in the mid-20th century, the "computer" came to denote electronic devices capable of performing various computational tasks automatically. Since then, computer architecture has been aroused as a field of study that explores the structure and operational principles of computer systems. It focuses on understanding how hardware and software components interact to achieve performance goals and optimize efficiency. Modern computer architectures emphasize energy efficiency and scalability, aiming to maximize performance while minimizing power consumption, which is crucial for mobile devices and data centers.
