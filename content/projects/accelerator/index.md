        Domain-specific accelerators have been widely adopted in various industries. Some workloads, such as neural network training, AI inference, and recommendation algorithms, employ specific patterns on memory access and resource utilization, making it more efficient to process them using specialized accelerators instead of general-purpose processors, e.g., CPU and GPU. These accelerators have specialized dataflow to optimize the hardware overhead of given workloads. For example, the accelerator can alleviate the bottleneck on the memory interface by reusing the data loaded into the on-chip buffer. The domain-specific accelerators can exploit specialized memory subsystems and processing elements to maximize resource utilization.
