        The memory system plays a crucial role in modern computer architectures. Especially, contemporary architectures are highly parallelized and often incorporate multiple cores within a single processor, demanding a capability for addressing multiple memory operations simultaneously. That's why recent memory systems employ shared cache memory for multiple CPU cores and use NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture for multiple processors.
