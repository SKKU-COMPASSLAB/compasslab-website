        The traditional von Neumann architecture faces limitations primarily due to the separation of processing units and memory, which leads to data movement bottlenecks and increased latency. In contrast, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and Near Data Processing (NDP) architectures have gained prominence because they can process the data without incurring costy data transaction across the memory hierarchy. Especially, PIM and NDP architectures offer potential performance gains by optimizing data access and processing while processing workloads such as AI acceleration since they include a large memory-intensive GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication) operation.
