        OS (Operating System) is a bridge between hardware and software, managing resources such as memory, processors, and storage devices efficiently. OS enables abstraction and standardization across diverse hardware platforms, making itself crucial in modern computer architectures. Furthermore, operating systems enforce security mechanisms to protect data and resources from unauthorized access or malicious software.
