The SKKU Computer Architecture and Systems Lab (COMPASS LAB) is a computer architecture research group in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at SKKU. Our mission is to show the right direction of future computer architectures and systems by conducting fundamental research in processor architectures, memory systems, and hardware/software interaction. We explore novel architectural techniques to improve the performance, energy-efficiency, reliability, and security of computer systems. Our research spans all layers of the computer system stack from application to system software to architecture to circuits for cross-layer optimizations.

We are actively recruiting highly motivated students who want to do research in computer architecture and systems. Preferred majors include computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. 

If you want to be a computer architect, please contact me at seokin@skku.edu.
